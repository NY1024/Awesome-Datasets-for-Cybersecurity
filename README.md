## Network

**[1]MACCDC2012**



https://www.netresec.com/?page=MACCDC



The U.S. National CyberWatch Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (MACCDC) is a premier event that offers college and university students a unique opportunity to test their cybersecurity skills in a competitive environment, focusing on the operational management and protection of network infrastructures while responding to real-world business challenges and defending against attacks from a volunteer Red Team.



**[2]Unified Host and Network Data Set**



https://csr.lanl.gov/data/2017/



The Unified Host and Network Dataset includes de-identified network and host events collected from the Los Alamos National Laboratory enterprise network over approximately 90 days, with logs from Windows-based enterprise computers and internal routers, allowing for integrated analysis while maintaining security by matching anonymized identities across both data types, with some exceptions for well-known ports, system-level users, and redundant services.

## Forensics

**[1]Digital Corpora**



http://digitalcorpora.org/



DigitalCorpora.org provides freely available digital corpora, including disk images, memory dumps, and network packet captures, for computer forensics education and research, with a special arrangement required for access to real-world data.



**[2]Verizon VERIS Database**



https://github.com/vz-risk/VCDB



The VERIS Community Database, supported by the Verizon RISK Team, aims to facilitate effective information sharing for collective intelligence in cybersecurity, despite challenges in sharing raw data due to partner agreements, and addresses the gap in comprehensive, publicly available datasets for security incident research and corporate decision-making.

## Authentication

**[1]User-Computer Authentication Associations in Time**



https://csr.lanl.gov/data/auth/



This anonymized dataset contains 708,304,516 successful authentication events collected over 9 continuous months from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) enterprise network, with each event recorded as "time,user,computer" in a comma-delimited format.

## Comprehensive dataset

**[1]Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events Auth**



https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/



This dataset comprises 58 consecutive days of de-identified event data from Los Alamos National Laboratoryâ€™s internal network, including Windows authentication events, process start/stop events, DNS lookups, network flow data, and red teaming events, totaling 12GB compressed and 1.65 billion events for 12,425 users, 17,684 computers, and 62,974 processes, with all data uniformly de-identified and no external associations included.
